Notes on using MiniSidewinder in LibreTexts (https://bio.libretexts.org/)

4/11/23

1. Currently libretexts simulations use miniSidewinder on github (https://github.com/sys-bio/miniSidewinder)
2. The template file, miniSidewinderLibreTextsTemplate.html, is placed within a libreTexts web page (filled out with a particular SBML model).
3. The template calls libreTextsLoadSim.html, which resides here, on Github. This file grabs the SBML file on LibreTexts and calls miniSidewinder with the simulation settings and model specified.

In the future, LibreTexts will host a version of miniSidewinder and associated files.


Current files (6) within ../docs/libreTexts/ :

- libreTextsLoadSim.html: Intermediary file used to load SBML file from a URL and pass on simulation settings and model text to miniSidewinder.
- libreTextsTemplateTestPage.html: Used to test template on local http server
- miniSidewinderLibreTextsPostMessageTemplate.html: Uses Window.postMessage() to send data. Template that may need to be used if sending the SBML model text directly from a webpage. Also may be necessary if total information sent to libreTextsLoadSim.html exceeds 2k chars.
- miniSidewinderLibreTextsTemplate.html: Current template used by libreTexts authors to place a model simulation within a webpage.
